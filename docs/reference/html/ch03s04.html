      Much like any software, a set of process definitions can grow larger,
      more complex and more intertwined as time goes. One solution used
      in the broader software world is encapsulation. This involves
      pulling out common functionality and breaking up large pieces into
      smaller components. These same techniques can be used with a set
      of process definitions. Rather than using copy/paste, sections of
      process definitions that are common can be extracted. Large
      process definitions can be split out into smaller components.
    </p><p>
      Sarasvati supports two ways of doing encapsulation, each with it's
      own advantages and disadvantages. The first is
      <span class="emphasis"><em>graph composition</em></span>
      , the second is
      <span class="emphasis"><em>nested processes</em></span>
      . Both of these techniques allow complete process definitions and
      components that have been split out to be defined in separately.
      The difference lies in when they are composed.

          <span class="emphasis"><em>Load-time composition</em></span>
          - Graph composition brings the disparate elements together at
          load time. The main definition being loaded may refer to other
          definitions. These definitions will be loaded as well and they
          will all be combined into a single definition. This single
          definition will execute as if it had been defined in a single
          file.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Run-time composition</em></span>
          - Nested processes use composition at runtime. The main
          definition will be loaded. When this definition is executed, a
          node may start a nested process. This nested process will
          execute and when completed, the main process will continue.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Now that we have general idea of how graph composition and nested
      processes compare, let us investigate them in more detail.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Graph composition</em></span>
          - The set of process definitions may be seen as a single,
          disconnected graph. A node may contain arcs to nodes in other
          process definitions. These arcs are referred to as
          <span class="emphasis"><em>external arcs</em></span>
          . When the process definition is loaded, referenced external
          process definitions will be loaded as well. All the process
          definitions will be composed into a single, larger graph. The
          external arcs will become regular arcs. The same external
          processes definition may be embedded more than once. Each
          <span class="emphasis"><em>external instance</em></span>
          of an external process definition will be given a unique
          identifier.

                  is updated, process definitions referring to it must

        Let's look at an examples of how this works in practice. Here is
        a small process definition which we want to embed. This process
        definition will be named
        <span class="emphasis"><em>ext</em></span>
        .
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts-externals1.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        It only has two nodes. Notice that both nodes are using the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>label-and</em></span> join strategy, even
        though one node has no inputs and the other only has one.
        However, in the composed graph these nodes may have more inputs.
      </p><p>
        Next is the process definition which will be using
        <span class="emphasis"><em>ext</em></span>.
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts-externals2.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        This process definition looks very different from previous examples. It
        isn't even fully connected.
</p><p>
        Some things to note:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
              The external arcs are labeled with the process definition name,
              instance and node name that they are intended to link to.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              In this case, all the arcs are connecting to the same
              instance of
              <span class="emphasis"><em>ext</em></span>
              , instance 1.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              Both in and out external arcs may connect to any node in the target
              external. They are not limited to just start nodes, for
              example.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>

        When the graph is loaded, the composed version will look as
        follows:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts-externals3.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="section" title="Graph Composition Example Two"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="concepts-graph-composition-example-two"></a>Graph Composition Example Two</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The previous example referenced only a single instance. Here is the
        example using two instances 'ext.
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts-externals4.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        When it is loaded, the composed graph looks like:
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts-externals5.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        As you can see, we now have two copies of
        <span class="emphasis"><em>ext</em></span>
        embedded in the process definition. One copy will be made for
        each unique instance referenced. A process definition can have
        references to any number of different external definitions and
        each external process definition can be imported any number of
        times.

        The above example could not be implemented with nested processes
        because a nested process must be represented by a single node in
        the parent process. So, here is a similar, but simpler example
        using nested processes.
</p><p>
        </p><div class="informalfigure"><div><img src="../images/concepts-nested1.jpg"></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Nodes
        <code class="literal">S</code>
        and
        <code class="literal">T</code>
        both refer to the nested process named
        <code class="literal">nested</code>
        . Note that
        <code class="literal">nested</code>
        is almost the same as
        <code class="literal">ext</code>
        , except that the first node is a start node. This is because
        <code class="literal">nested</code>
        will be executed as a separate process. If it didn't have a
        start node, it would not execute.
      </p><p>
        When
        <code class="literal">S</code>
        and
        <code class="literal">T</code>
        execute, each will spawn a separate process. When
        <code class="literal">S</code>
        is executed, it will have an incomplete node token
        <code class="literal">t</code>
        . As part of execution it will start a new
        <code class="literal">nested</code>
        process
        <code class="literal">P</code>
        which have have the token
        <code class="literal">t</code>
        as a parent. When
        <code class="literal">P</code>
        completes, it will check if it has a parent token, and finding
        that it does, will complete
        <code class="literal">t</code>
        . This will allow execution to continue in the original process.
